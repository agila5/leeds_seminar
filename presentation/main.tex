\begin{itemize}
	\setlength\itemsep{1em}
	\item I'm Andrea Gilardi, a Ph.D. student in Statistics at the University of Milan - Bicocca. 
	\item My main research interests lie in the field of spatial and spatiotemporal statistics, with a particular focus on point pattern events on a linear network. I really love coding in R. 
	
	\item Now I'm in Leeds (I will leave next week unfortunately) working with Robin Lovelace on a review of existing packages for spatial network analysis in R (like \texttt{stplanr}) to improve my knowledge on several spatial topics and apply the methods to road safety research

	\item Informally, a \textbf{Point Process} is a random mechanism whose outcomes are \textbf{Point Patterns}, i.e. a (finite) sequence of points in the space. 
	
	\item Classical examples of point processes are: tree locations in a forest (the classic swedish pines data), animal nesting sites, ambulance interventions or, as  in this seminar, car crashes. 
	
	\item We will use these data to formalize the first steps we took towards the definition of a precise model that can be used to locate the most dangerous locations for car crashes (i.e. the black spots).

\begin{itemize}
	\setlength\itemsep{1em}
	\item In the following part of this seminar, we will analyze data for car crashes that occurred in the Isle of Wight (UK) during 2018. 
	
	\item We downloaded the data using the \texttt{stats19} package, which is a tool to help download, process and analyse the UK road collision data collected using the 'STATS19' form. 
	
	\item These data are really rich and they include several additional information (like the severity of the crash, the weather, the light condition and several other markers) but, for the moment, we will focus only on the location of the events.

  \item The road network we use is built using OpenStreetMap data. 
  \item OpenStreetMap is a project that aims at building a free and editable map of the World with an open-content license. 
  \item The basic components of OpenStreetMap data are called \textit{elements} and they consist of: 
  \begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{0.25em}
    \item \textit{nodes}: representing points on the earth surface; 
    \item \textit{ways}: which is an ordered list of nodes; 
    \item \textit{relations}: which is a list of nodes, ways and other relations. Each member has additional information that describe its relationship with the other elements. Roads, turn restrictions and administrative boundaries are usually described as relations.

  \vspace{-0.75cm}
  \begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{1em}
    \item Broadly speaking, let's say that a street network is a network whose nodes and edges are associated with geographical elements in the space. 
    \item In the \texttt{stplanr} representation of a street network, the edges are the ways that were download from OSM while the vertexes are the starting and ending node of each way. 
    \item This representation implies that two or more edges are \textit{connected} if and only if they share one or more boundary point. 
  \end{itemize}

  \frametitle{Problems...}
  \vspace{-0.5cm}
  Theories and definitions are fine but obviously the data we face in the wild world is quite different. We will discuss three probems: \textbf{roundabouts} (i.e. circular ways), \textbf{overpasses} (i.e. intersecting ways that are not really connected due to a vertical grade of separation) and (some) \textbf{street intersections}.

\frametitle{Fixing the street networks}

Summary of the models
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Counting crashes on street networks}
\vspace{-0.75cm}
\begin{itemize}
	\setlength\itemsep{1em}
	\item Following the same ideas behind the quadratcounts on the plane (and some statistical theories) we wrote a few function to count the number of car crashes occurring on each edge of the street network. 
	\item R can only represent exactly integers numbers and fractions whose denominator is a power of two (source), so none of the car crashes (whose coordinates are represented as double numbers with a 53 binary digits accuracy) lie exactly on the street network.
	\item For that reason we wrote a few R function to match each car crash with the nearest edge on the network and count the occurrences.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{The first road risk measure}
\vspace{-0.25cm}
This is the result. You should note that we excluded all car crashes that were farther than 100m from the nearest network edge (33  crashes). 
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/count_on_nearest_street}
\end{figure}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Problems with the raw counts measure}
\begin{itemize}
	\setlength\itemsep{1em}
	\item There are some clear problems with the previous risk measure and, the most important one, is that we are comparing ways with very different length (i.e. different \textit{exposure}). 
	\item There are two possible solutions: 1) rebuild the network cutting and pasting ways in such a way that they all have approximately the same length; 2) estimate the number of car crashes per meter. 
	\item For the moment we are working with the second solution since the other one is much more difficult to implement. 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Car crashes per meter}
\vspace{-0.25cm}
This is the result and, then again, there are some obvious problems: there are a few car crashes occurring in very small road segments that artificially inflate this risk index.

	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/car_crashes_per_meter}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Local smoothing on a linear network}
\vspace{-0.75cm}
\begin{itemize}
	\setlength\itemsep{1em}
	\item Let $n$ be the number of (non overlapping) edges in the street network, $x_i, \ i = 1,\dots,n$ the number of car crashes occurring in each edge and $l_i, \ i = 1\dots n$ the length of each way. The ratio 
	\[
	y_i = \frac{x_i}{l_i}, \ i = 1, \dots, n
	\] 
	represent the number of car crashes per meter. 
	
	\item Let $\delta_{i, p}$ represent the set of all neighbours of each street $i$ up to order $p$. If $p = 0$ then $\delta_{i, p}$ includes only the $i$-th street segment; if $p = 1$ then $\delta_{i, 1}$ includes the street segment $i$ and its neighbours\footnote{In the \texttt{stplanr} representation of street networks, two ways are neighbours if they share one boundary point}; if $p = 2$ then $\delta_{i,2}$ includes the street segment, its neighbours and the neighbours of its neighbours and so on\dots
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Local smoothing on a linear network}
\vspace{-0.5cm}
\begin{itemize}
	\setlength\itemsep{1em}
	\item Now we can perform a local smoothing of $y_i$, i.e. the number of car crashes per meter, as
	\[
	\tilde{y}_i = \frac{1}{m_i}\sum_{j \in \delta_{i, p}} y_{j} 
	\]
	where $m_i$ represent the number of elements included in $\delta_{i, p}$. 
	
	\item The value of $p$ is an input for the procedure and represent the degree of the smoothing: small values represent a local smoothing while higher values create a "global" smoothing. For example if we take $p = n$ then every segment is linked with the same value, i.e. $\tilde{y} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}y_{i} \ \forall i = 1, \dots, n$. 
	
	\item We'll see later a few methods that can be used to decide the value of $p$. 
	\item The procedure was coded using the \texttt{igraph} package.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Smoothing on a linear network}
\vspace{-0.25cm}
This is the result with $p = 6$ and now it's possible to extract some information from the plot.

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Why network cleaning is important?}
\vspace{-0.25cm}
This is the same procedure applied to the street network without the cleaning and with $p = n$. It's clear that there is something wrong.
\begin{figure}

	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/importance_of_network_cleaning}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Drawbacks}
\vspace{-0.75cm}
\begin{itemize}
	\setlength\itemsep{1em}
	\item Nevertheless, even if we work with a proper and clean network, the smoothing procedure has several drawbacks since it is nothing more than an exploratory data analysis (EDA) procedure. 
	
	\item We did not define any precise statistical model which implies that we can't quantify any uncertainty measure on the risk indexes. Moreover, inference and testing procedures are not clearly defined. 
	
	\item In the last part of this seminar I'm going to present a statistical approach for the estimation of risk index on a street network which is based on \alert{Emprical Bayes Estimators}. 	
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Setting up the terminology}
\vspace{-0.75cm}
\begin{itemize}
	\setlength\itemsep{1em}
	\item  Let $n$ be the number of (non overlapping) edges in the street network and $x_i$ be the number of car crashes occurring in each edge. We assume that
	\[
	x_i \sim \alert{\text{Poisson}}(l_i\theta_i)
	\] 	
	where $l_i$ represents the \alert{exposure} on each segment and $\theta_i$ is the \alert{risk measure of the $i$th street segment}. 
	\item There are several possible ways to measure the exposure of each segment and, for the moment, we are going to assume that $l_i$ represents the length of the $i$th segment. 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Setting up the terminology (cont)}
\vspace{-0.75cm}
\begin{itemize}
	\setlength\itemsep{1em}
	\item We can now define 
	\[
	y_{i} = \frac{x_i}{l_i}
	\]  
	which is just the ratio between the number of car crashes and the length of the edge and, under the previous assumptions, represent the maximum likelihood estimates of $\theta_i$. 
	
	% It's easy to prove that $\mathbb{E}[y_i] = \theta_i$ (i.e. unbiased estimator) and $\text{var}[y_i] = \frac{\theta_i}{l_i}$.
	
	\item It's possible to prove that $\text{var}[y_i] = \frac{\theta_i}{l_i}$, which implies that the lower is the exposure, the more inaccurate is the estimate $y_i$. Moreover, it's possible to prove that, taken together, $\lbrace y_i, \ i = 1,\dots,n\rbrace$ are not necessarily the best\footnote{with a squared loss function} estimates of $\lbrace \theta_i, \ i = 1, \dots, n \rbrace$.   
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Classical and Bayesian statistics}
\vspace{-0.75cm}
\begin{itemize}
	\setlength\itemsep{1em}
	\item The classical statistical setting is based on the assumption that $\theta_i$, the parameter that we want to estimate, is a fixed and unknown quantity and all the inferential procedures are based on the \textit{repeated sampling principle} (i.e. we imagine it's possible to get other samples $\lbrace x_i, \ i = 1,\dots,n \rbrace$ which are generated under the same random mechanism). 
	\item Instead, in a bayesian framework, the sample is fixed while the parameters $\theta_i$ represent a random quantity that should be specified as a \textit{random variable} with its \textit{prior distribution}. We can include in the \textit{prior distirbution} all the previous knowledge we have on $\theta_{i}$, like its mean, median, modal quantity or range of variation. The statisticians then use the Bayes theorem to combine the 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Setting up the terminology (cont)}
\vspace{-0.75cm}
\begin{itemize}
	\setlength\itemsep{1em}
	\item Now we are going to adopt a bayesian mindset specifying $\theta_i$ as a random variable with mean $\mu_i$ and variance $\sigma^2_i$, without any explicit functional form. 
	
	\item So this is the framework 
	\[
	x_i | \theta_i \sim \text{Poisson}(l_i\theta_i) \text{ and } \theta_i \sim (\mu_i, \sigma^2_i). 
	\]  
	
	\item If we define $y_i$ in the same manner as before, then $\mathbb{E}[y_i | \theta_i] = \theta_i$ and $\text{var}[y_i | \theta_i] = \frac{\theta_{i}}{l_i}$. By the law of iterated expected values 
	\[
	\mathbb{E}[y_i] = \mathbb{E}[\mathbb{E}[y_i|\theta_{i}]] = \mu_i
	\]
	and
	\[
	\text{var}[y_i] = \text{var}[\mathbb{E}[y_i | \theta_i]] + \mathbb{E}[\text{var}[y_i|\theta_{i}]] = \sigma^2_i + \frac{\mu_i}{l_i} = \nu_i
	\]
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Shrinkage Estimator}
\vspace{-0.75cm}
\begin{itemize}
	\setlength\itemsep{1em}
	\item It's possible to prove that the best linear Bayesian estimator for $\lbrace \theta_{i}, \ i = 1, \dots, n \rbrace$ is given by the \alert{shrinkage estimator}:
	\[
	\hat{\theta_i} = P_iy_i + (1 - P_i)\mu_i, \ i = 1, \dots, n
	\]
	where $P_i = \frac{\sigma^2_i}{\nu_i}$. 
	
	\item We can see that $\hat{\theta_i}$ is a weighted average of the prior mean, $\mu_i$ and $y_i$, the raw estimate for $\theta_{i}$. The weights $P_i$ are proportional to the exposure, which means that the grater is $l_i$, and the more important is $y_i$ in the estimation of $\theta_i$ 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{An Empirical Bayes Approach}
\vspace{-0.75cm}
\begin{itemize}
	\setlength\itemsep{1em}
	\item There are two problems now. The first problem is that the number of parameters in the model is greater than the number of edges in the network (which makes the model unidentifiable). We can solve it by assuming that $\mu_i = \mu \ \forall i$ and $\sigma^2_i = \sigma^2 \ \forall i$. 
	
	\item The second problem is that we don't know $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ but, using the James-Stein approach, we can estimate them using the marginal distribution of $Y$ (since we proved that $\mathbb{E}[y_i] = \mu$ and $\text{var}[y_i] = \sigma^2$). This is called an Empirical Bayes Approach. 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{An Empirical Bayes Approach (cont)}
\vspace{-0.75cm}
\begin{itemize}
	\setlength\itemsep{1em}
	\item If we don't specify any functional form for the prior of $\theta$, we can still use the methods of moment for the estimation of $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$. 
	
	\item We will use
	\[
	\begin{split}
		& \tilde{\mu} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} l_iy_i}{\sum_{i=1}^n l_i}, \\
		& \tilde{\sigma}^2 = \max\left\lbrace 0, S^2 - \frac{\tilde{\mu}}{\bar{l}}\right\rbrace,
	\end{split}
	\]
	and
	\[
	\tilde{P}_i = \frac{\tilde{\sigma}^2}{\tilde{\sigma}^2 + \frac{\tilde{\mu}}{l_i}} 
	\]
	and the empirical version of the shrinkage estimator is
	\[
	\hat{\theta}_i = \tilde{P}_iy_i + (1 - \tilde{P}_i)\tilde{\mu}
	\]
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{A spatial version of Empirical Bayes}
\vspace{-0.75cm}
\begin{itemize}
	\setlength\itemsep{1em}
	\item The problem now is that we are completely ignoring the spatial component of the model (i.e. if we randomly shuffle all the counts $x_i$ the $\hat{\theta}_i$ doesn't change). 
	
	\item We can fix that using the same approach as before, i.e. we can define a set $\delta_{i, p}$ which represent all the neghbours of the $i$th edge up to order $p$ and modify all the previous formula just to take into account just the edges included in $\delta_{i, p}$. For example
	\[
	\tilde{\mu}_{i, 1} = \frac{\sum_{j \in \delta_{i, p}} y_jl_j}{\sum_{j \in \delta_{i, p}} l_j}
	\]
	is the empirical estimate of $\mu$ for the $i$th edge considering all neighbours up to order 1. 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\vspace{-0.25cm}
\frametitle{Problems \dots}
We tried to apply that methodology to our data with several possible choices of $p$ but it soon became clear that it didn't work (as you can see from the following figure with $p = 6$). But why?

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{The lengths of the OSM ways data}
\vspace{-0.75cm}
\begin{itemize}
	\setlength\itemsep{1em}
	\item The problem is that $\hat{\theta}_i$ is a convex combination between the number of car crashes per meter and a local average measure where the weights are defined by $P_i = \frac{\sigma^2_i}{\sigma^2_i + \frac{\mu_i}{l_i}}$. 
	
	\item In our case it occurred (by chance) that a few car crashes happened really close to the short edges in the network while all the other surrounding ways remained "empty". This means that $P_i \to 1$, $\hat{\theta}_i \to y_i$ and our methodology fails to solve that problem.
	
	\item  We need an algorithm to merge the shortest $z\%$ of segments with its nearest and shortest neighbour. We choose $z = 15\%$.
