A few random ideas:

1.  Car crashes data for IOW
    1.  Definition of Non-Homogeneous Poisson Point Process
    2.  How to get the data (STATS19)
    3.  Smoothing Estimation of Intensity Function (i.e. ignoring the
        network)
2.  Street Network data for IOW
    1.  Definition
    2.  How to get the data (geofabric)
    3.  Pitfalls and how to solve them
3.  (Maybe) How to split the network
4.  Modelling:
    1.  Projections of car crashes on street network and raw counts
    2.  Non-parametric smoothing (i.e. London course methods)
    3.  Why network preprocessing is important
    4.  Empirical Bayes
        1.  definition
        2.  Measure of correlation
        3.  graphical results
